	  Game developers:  harder coding<br>
	  and yet ... less pay.  Why?<br><br><br>  

	  (Is economics a science?)<br><br><br> 
	  The American Dream is rarely achieved alone and that's not just because of the 
	  financial difficulty.  The one bit of information your boss and co-workers retain
	  about you is whether you have a wife and kids or you're a complete loner.<br><br><br>
	  hypothesis:  restaurants get better meats than grocery stores<br>
	  (perhaps the processing is different?)<br><br><br>

	  &nbsp;&nbsp; The middle ground is very hard to achieve sociologically.  On one hand, I wouldn't want just one 
	  company to dominate a market.  That monopoly turns into a utility, which almost immediately turns into a government, perhaps?
	  On the other hand, a flooded market obviously drowns, although I have a zest for variety, diversity and beer.<br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;If one country dominates the manufacturing of a certain type of product, where do we look for a change?  Nearby countries? 
	  If you've been following my work for awhile, you probably know that I'm thinking about Japan - cars and computing gadgets.
	  (Also low poverty and low crime.) 
	  Why aren't all of our cars and computing gadgets from Japan?  I'm sure there are many factors, not the least of which is the 
	  powerful loyalty of Americans.  People are very social and will often choose whatever product gets them friends "on the right side."
	  Furthermore, any intellectual concept, whether sociological or psychological, probably cannot be just
	  a one-way road.  It isn't simply a matter of the best groups or individuals rising to the top.  (At the same time,
	  who are those powerful people hurting?)  There is plenty of evil in our world to combat,
	  although ideally we could almost eliminate evil.  How do you combat negativity while remaining positive?
	  The middle ground is very hard to achieve.<br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp; I crave new ideas.  I think this is more of a psychological concept than a sociological concept.  My point is to
	  not be heavily influenced by pop trends or promises of "new deals."  (omg, this is an election year!) Look back on history and see the similarities
	  among eras, 
	  the social stagnation
	  and all the problems that have just been repeated over and over and over again.  See extreme language as a warning sign.
	  Find your way out, then find your way back in, because it ain't over until
	  the coma ends.  And remember, according to Stephen Coldbeer, the word "Japs" can be used in a politically correct way if it is done to save ink.<br><br><br>

	  The more guesses, the better chance of guessing right.<br><br><br>

	  A man with a 25-inch penis goes to a doctor to see if the penis can be reduced in size.  The doctor says,
	  "Go to the frog in the woods and ask the frog to marry you.  Each time the frog says no, you will lose 5 inches
	  off your penis."<br>
	  So the guy goes to the frog in the woods and asks, "Frog, will you marry me?"<br>
	  The frog says, "No."<br>
	  Poof.  The guy loses 5 inches off his penis.<br>
	  The guy asks again, "Frog, will you marry me?"<br>
	  The frog says, "No."<br>
	  Poof.  The guy loses another 5 inches off his penis.<br>
	  The guy thinks, "Hhhmmmm, 15 inches is still too big, but 10 would be perfect."<br>
	  So he asks the frog one more time, "Frog, will you marry me?"<br>
	  The frog says, "I told you, NO! NO! NO!"<br><br><br>

    'people's way of keeping everything from happening at once,<br>
     Overtake the light, time is in your sight,<br>
     and black holes bend the beams so <br>
     nothing's where it seems and<br>
     finding out the truth could take you months.' "<br><br>
