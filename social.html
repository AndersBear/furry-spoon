      gaslighting: a form of manipulation that often occurs in abusive relationships;
      It is a covert (not openly acknowledged or displayed) type of emotional abuse where the bully or abuser misleads the target,

  Humans are <i>too social</i>.  This means many things:

  Thought experiment:<br><br>
You had a normal childhood.  Then you were abandoned on an island.

  Believe it or not, there were anti-Nazi Germans in Nazi Germany.  (example: Dietrich Bonhoeffer, killed, 1945)
  There are anti-communists in communist countries.  There are people in India who are against
  the caste system and arranged marriages.  Faceapp, wherever it came from, is a pretty good app and
  $30 a year is a pretty good price.<br><br>

     can't go back in.  She just wasn't fully gay.  She had some weird thoughts about Jesus and
     Mother Mary and Father Joseph.  Then she learned about Buddha's son and the psychology of it all finally
     became clear.  Now she knew why there was a slight diffence in how her male friends treated her
     at their coming-out parties.  Although she knew most of this was psychobabble, she had the time
     to hone it.  She was free now in a way she hadn't planned.  After all, it was Friday.<br><br>
