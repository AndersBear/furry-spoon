      Here is the "female" gameboard, which sits/slides atop the "male" gameboard,
      but I haven't figured out the positions yet.  (I think it goes: negative, neutral, neutral, positive)<br>

      The all-male group desperately seeks a guy like me to frame-and-blame for their liking each other so much.<br>
      I might react a little differently to an all-female group.<br><br>

    <div class="boxed"><br>
      i use ta feel sad for celebs gettin paparazzi'd and leaked and all that imagery stuff, but pretty soon
      everyone will assume most or alot of it is fake and we'll all win.  (Satan cancels himself out! Ba Ha Ha !)<br><br>

      Some people carry sociological concepts with them wherever they go.  They master self-centeredness simultaneously with these 
      sociological concepts and they probably know no other ways, so it's prolly rude not to do that?<br><br>
