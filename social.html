      My own little "game", which I have developed over the years:<br>
      <br>
      Personality types:<br>
      <img src="Chart_personality.jpg"></img><br><br><br>
      Motives:<br> 
      <img src="Chart_personality_2.jpg"></img><br><br><br>
      Intelligence types:<br>
      <img src="Chart_intelligence.jpg"></img><br><br>
      Sexuality types:<br>
      <img src="Chart_sexuality.jpg"></img><br><br>
      <br><br><br><br>
      Here is the "female" gameboard, which sits/slides atop the "male" gameboard,
      but I haven't figured out the positions yet.  (I think it goes: negative, neutral, neutral, positive)<br>
      <img src="Chart_other.jpg"></img><br><br>
      possible rough draft:<br>
      <img src="FemaleGameBoard.jpg"></img><br><br>
      The female game board is simpler.  It is linear, the "ranking" goes from left to right.  In other words,
      the middle-right neutral position is better than the middle-left neutral position.
      (-, n, n, +)<br><br><br> 
      Some miscellaneous characteristics:<br><br>
      <img src="Chart_sexy.jpg"></img><br><br>
      Imagine: people are using these ideas to analyze movies.
      <img src="Chart_misc.jpg"></img><br><br><br> 
      Each position can be split, perhaps more than once.  Take the lower left position for example.
      A man is proud to be on the right side of it, but arrogance creeps back in, because
      he thinks that position is the entire gameboard.<br><br><br>
      The 4 edge (corner) positions tend to keep going off the edge.  The 2 center positions tend to go up/down.<br><br><br>  
      The female gameboard positions tend to go inward, because they know it's just a game and women tend to kiss and hug more than men.
      Also, any change of direction isn't as obvious as with men.  The movement tends to be more internal.<br><br><br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;After giving up on owning a house, I moved into a fancy 2-BR apartment and looked for a roommate.  Rather surprisingly, this 20-year-old woman
          non-chalantly says she'll give it a shot, which felt weird.  I mean, here's this chick who's half my ... daughter's age.  We agreed
          there would never be any mention of sex.  That was fine.  We both just needed to save money.  One weekend night, she has her
          girlyfriends over and ... they ... were ... ... ... energetic, to say the least, talking incessantly until 3:00 in the morning.
          The last hour was the most intense.  The conversation seemed metaphorically hostile, yet still tolerable.  On the sharpest, loudest
          note, my roommate's girlyfriends abruptly left.  I was afraid she was going to look at me with an intensely serious look and give me a threat 
          that would knock my testicules off, but to my suprise, she smiled and slowly blinked.  That became our secret code for ... something I might
