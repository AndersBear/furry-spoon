         &nbsp;&nbsp;I've been thinking about human history and how we have the choice to live worse, the same or better than our ancestors, 
      psychologically and sociologically.  As usual, I try to diagram the concepts.  Considering the many possibilities of the human mind, 
      the concepts easily fit into my usual "negative, neutral, positive" diagram.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Negative</strong>:  Spying has probably been around for a very long time.  You can call it eavesdropping, encroaching or 
      whatever else.  Certain technologies have facilitated these lifestyles, just like any other lifestyles.  ("There has been phone tapping 
      ever since there have been phones.")  As a victim of spying, I have learned things I would've hardly ever imagined: there are spies who 
      spy on their victims 24/7, literally "living" for spying.  There is a lot of psychology that goes with spying, almost all of it bad,
      exept for use in war/crime.  Basically, I think of spying on innocent people  
      as de-evolution.  Who chooses to live that way?  Just thinking about the minds of spies can be fascinating and, I'm sorry, amusing.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Neutral</strong>:  It seems that both major political parties in America know too well how to put the majority of people 
      into a multi-faceted dilemma.  (It happens every time!)  The recent 2024 election probably wasn't widely considered refreshing.  Old-fashioned 
      and restrictive ways of thinking seem to be as prominent as ever.  I can't think of a much more sensitive and important concept than sex.  
      I know what you're thinking: it's completely private.  I mostly agree, but when it comes to the termination of innocent, defenseless and 
      voiceless human life, perhaps that line is slightly blurred.  If your neighbor habitually kills children, where do you draw the line?  Even 
      disregarding abortion, what about equality of parents in the workplace?  Policies don't have to be restrictive.  They can be inspiring.  New 
      and encouraging ways of allowing people to balance family and work can be imagined.  Of course, putting them into place is another story.  As 
      someone interested in science, I find the PlanB pill to be another fascinating advent in human history.  Most adult human bodies produce eggs 
      and sperm that eventually die naturally.  Therefore, it is not a "sin" to block egg and sperm from uniting, whether physically or chemically.  
      PlanB is <i>not</i> an abortifacient drug.  It does not kill a fertilized egg.  PlanB is probably one of the greatest scientific advancements 
      of our time.  How long will it take some of our minds to catch up?<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Positive</strong>:  When sitting at the top of a slippery slope, all you have to do is face the right direction.  Humans have indeed 
      learned some positive things.  Through the pros and cons of social media, certain impoverished groups are gaining equality, although I don't think 
      politics should be solely about social issues.  Every era has its problems and solutions.  There is no reason to think life has to deteriorate.  
      In my opinionated opinion, a belief in the afterlife is another hurdle that can bring happiness when accepted or overcome.  Even considering religion as 
      philosophy or disregarding religion altogether, most of us want each other to be happy and good compromises can be obtained.<br><br>
