  Humans are <i>too social</i>.  This means many things:

     She was happy to never have come out.  Not because she believed gays shouldn't come out.  In
     fact, she felt that they should come out.  Nor did she believe that once you come out, you 
     can't go back in.  She just wasn't fully gay.  She had some weird thoughts about Jesus and
     Mother Mary and Father Joseph.  Then she learned about Buddha's son and the psychology of it all finally
     became clear.  Now she knew why there was a slight difference in how her male friends treated her
     at their coming-out parties.  Although she knew most of this was psychobabble, she had the time
     to hone it.  She was free now in a way she hadn't planned.  After all, it was Friday.<br><br>

      He was over 30 now and sometimes got ridiculed by the high schoolers.  He was embarrasingly and reluctantly learning life lessons over and over,
      year after year.  Even though his career dealt with technical concepts, people always came back to people and boy could 
      they be wicked.  The men and women at work liked him, but their "phases" usually seemed to change abruptly, leaving him feeling lonely and disliked. 
      One of his closest friends was married and raising kids now.  Plenty of women flirted with him, even married ones, but the ultimate
      relationship eluded him.  It just hadn't happened.  This wasn't quite the lifestyle he had planned.  He was good at his job, but
      considering his age and his single status, instead of getting promoted, he feared the opposite.  His personality was naturally 
      changing and evolving.  He was learning all the "tricks" of life.  He faced it honestly and openly.  Was this why people seemed so wicked?<br><br>

     She was brought up well.  Went to a very good state college.  Met another alpha suburbanite.  They married by 30.  Now they're 50.  The phases
     have gotten longer and longer and therefore she has had more time to ponder.  It's not a question of whether he loves her.  It's a 
     more finely-tuned question.  Does he love her more than he loves himself?  Is he more interested in the female gender or the male gender?
     Despite all the distractions, there were only two choices.  She finally knew it.  He had always been chauvinistic.  But how could
     she divorce him now?  His main argument was, "We're all the same."  He gave her several beautiful children, excellent financial skills
     and a wide social network.  He had behaved himself around her for many years now, going through all the motions of what they both agreed 
     was proper protocol about how a man should be, especially when the public spotlight was on them.  In the early years, 
     that was a chore for him, but now it was easy and he enjoyed it.  After all, he was intimate with an alpha female.  There was no 
     tangible or even visual reason for her to divorce him.  There were only the standard "irreconcilable differences."  (Would the divorce be "amicable"?)
     Their friends would be baffled if they broke up and some of them were bound to blame her.  So ... she kept putting it off.  Now they were becoming grandparents.<br><br>

      I don't think your public and private personas should be opposites.  I think one should simply be a little more pronounced than
       the other.  I guess that's the difference between an introvert and an extrovert.  Neither one is a flip-flopper, a Dr.Jeckyll/Mr.Hyde.
       One just prefers public and one prefers private.<br><br>

       A man came back from the Vietnam War very distraught, but also very glad to meet up with an old friend.  They talked about the war.
       The soldier said, "It was so tricky, psychologically and even worse sociologically.  I only saw a few women the whole time and 
       they seemed like they enjoyed all the tricks and the torture.  It was so confusing."<br>
       Noticing that his friend was seriously and perhaps permanently agitated, the other guy made a desperate suggestion.<br>
       "Look.  I know a therapist.  She's older.  She's Oriental, you know, from the same area you were just at.  She's experienced, quiet, 
       gentle and highly intelligent."<br>
       "No thanks, man.  Sounds creepy," the soldier declined.<br>
       Realizing that soldiers, like most men, rarely sought counseling, the friend spoke a little longer, trying to convince
       the soldier that all of life can be so tricky.<br>
       Finally, the soldier gave in.  "Okay," he said.  "I'll go see her.  Hey, what kind of therapist is she?  You know ... buddhist?  or
       ... Freudian? or what?"<br>
       The friend replied, "Massage."<br><br>
