      Well, which acters did you enjoy having in your living room for the Super Bowl?  I liked Aubrey.  I often wonder if 
      she really is a mean, evil hag or if there's a very caring, kind, loving woman deep down in there who just doesn't 
      want to break character.  I also liked the one who said, "Tom ... you can stay."<br><br>

      The all-male group desperately seeks a guy like me to frame-and-blame for their liking each other so much.<br>
      I might react a little differently to an all-female group, but probably not much.  You have to realize that
      it's not such a neat thing, no matter how it formed.<br><br>

      Some people carry sociological concepts with them wherever they go.  They master self-centeredness simultaneously with these 
      sociological concepts and they probably know no other ways, so it's prolly rude NOT to do that?<br><br>
      Anyway, then their sociology becomes their psychology.<br><br>

       We hate to admit it, but politics is just a popularity game, both sides are back-and-forth, playing their 
       sociological "cards" - racism, sexism, economics, etc.  (In America, it's been over since 1865.)  Anyway, this 
       has inspired my upcoming single.  It's another weird one called,
       "The Race to Condoleezza".<br><br>
       (For those of you who don't know, Condoleezza is a neuro-Nordic-Arabic underground city near New Zealand, east-west of the
       Thai-Miami-Nairobi penninshula.)<br><br>

        Growing up in GB, on the summer weekends, we either went "up North" or to Kewaunee.  My dad's friend owned/operated a bar in Kewaunee (Algoma?). 
        It had that warmcool scent of well water and the breeze of Lake Michigan.  They served excellent orange soda that we just couldn't get enough of.  
        It was a couple miles from the outskirts of town,
        in the open countryside.  It was called ... The Grove.<br><br>

         The college psych class had been discussing some really weird personality concepts and how personalities were conditioned by childhood and also by 
         sociology, free will and even religion.  After a long few weeks, the prof announced to the class that today they were free to self-diagnose.
         As usual, it was a long, drawn-ought discussion full of pride, arrogance and derision, but it was also Henry's chance to shine.  When it was 
         his turn to self-diagnose, he proudly proclaimed, "Undeclared!"<br><br>
