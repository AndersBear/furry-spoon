         vastly larger than the other group's population.  Everybody knows that the majority of both groups make a big deal of the difference in appearance even
         though both groups are one species and the differences in appearance were only caused by environmental influences and a long period of time
         (which included many generations.)  Furthermore, even a few individuals of the smaller-populated group have achieved the highest "scores"
         in various categories.  Disregarding any further information or opinions about the minds of either group, in which group would you rather be?<br><br>

       Virginity is obviously a very valuable lifestyle, especially for females.  I just never thought much about it because
       I've always been a horndog.  Furthermore, you know I joke about having a harem of girlfriends, but what about a woman
       who has a harem of boyfriends?  Someone should do a study on that.  Imagine the numbers.<br><br>
