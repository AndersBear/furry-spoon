      Well, which acters did you enjoy having in your living room for the Super Bowl?  I liked Aubrey.  I often wonder if 
      she really is a mean, evil hag or if there's a very caring, kind, loving woman deep down in there who just doesn't 
      want to break character.  I also liked the one who said, "Tom ... you can stay."<br><br>

      Some people carry sociological concepts with them wherever they go.  They master self-centeredness simultaneously with these 
      sociological concepts and they probably know no other ways, so it's prolly rude NOT to do that?<br><br>
      Anyway, then their sociology becomes their psychology.<br><br>  
      If you analyze even more, you see that they're perfectionists when it comes to their ideologies.  They like to think in terms of EVERYONE.<br><br>
      (How do they know EVERYONE?  Do they go door-to-door?  Are they like the spies, cataloging EVERYONE?)<br><br>

       We hate to admit it, but politics is just a popularity game, both sides are back-and-forth, playing their 
       sociological "cards" - racism, sexism, economics, etc.  (In America, it's been over since 1865.)  Anyway, this 
       has inspired my upcoming single.  It's another weird one called,
       "The Race to Condoleezza".<br><br>
       (For those of you who don't know, Condoleezza is a neuro-Nordic-Arabic underground city near New Zealand, east-west of the

        Growing up in GB, on the summer weekends, we either went "up North" or to Kewaunee.  My dad's friend owned/operated a bar in Kewaunee (Algoma?). 
        It had that warmcool scent of well water and the breeze of Lake Michigan.  They served excellent orange soda that we just couldn't get enough of.  
        It was a couple miles from the outskirts of town,
        in the open countryside.  It was called ... The Grove.<br><br>

         The college psych class had been discussing some really weird personality concepts and how personalities were conditioned by childhood and also by 
         sociology, free will and even religion.  After a long few weeks, the prof announced to the class that today they were free to self-diagnose.
         As usual, it was a long, drawn-ought discussion full of pride, arrogance and derision, but it was also Henry's chance to shine.  When it was 
         his turn to self-diagnose, he proudly proclaimed, "Undeclared!"<br><br>

         hypothesis (I don't think anyone could ever come close to accurately knowing these numbers, but I still think about them):  not quite as large a

         (In fact, the percentage might be changing.  "We better get to work if we're going to turn this thing around and accuse the Republicans.")<br><br> 

         You don't want to accuse the male Dems, because it's one of those subjects that makes them VERY MAD.  (the subject AND the trick)<br><br>

      There was a kid in my high school class who murdered some dude.  The two had fought earlier that day.  After the murder, he called 
      the pizza man to find the body, but he still basically got away with the murder. Later, he turned himself in.  I can just imagine.  The MediaSpies
      probably watched the whole thing (or watched the video) and now they were broadcasting hints 24/7.  Everywhere he looked, everybody knew he did it.  
      This was 
      around 1987.<br><br>
      Just like the O.J. murder and countless rapes - the spies watched.<br><br>  
      There was another guy my age whose stepfather killed him, his mother and then himself.  This was Ashwaubenon, an affluent suburb.<br><br>
