      My own little "game", which I have developed over the years:<br>
      <br>
      Personality types:<br>
      <img src="Chart_personality.jpg"></img><br><br><br>
      Motives:<br>

      Here is the "female" gameboard, which sits/slides atop the "male" gameboard,
      but I haven't figured out the positions yet.  (I think it goes: negative, neutral, neutral, positive)<br>
      <img src="Chart_other.jpg"></img><br><br>
      possible rough draft:<br>
      <img src="FemaleGameBoard.jpg"></img><br><br>
      The female game board is simpler.  It is linear, the "ranking" goes from left to right.  In other words,
      the middle-right neutral position is better than the middle-left neutral position.
      (-, n, n, +)<br><br><br> 
      Some miscellaneous characteristics:<br><br>
      <img src="Chart_sexy.jpg"></img><br><br>
      Imagine: people are using these ideas to analyze movies.
      <img src="Chart_misc.jpg"></img><br><br><br> 
      Each position can be split, perhaps more than once.  Take the lower left position for example.
      A man is proud to be on the right side of it, but arrogance creeps back in, because
      he thinks that position is the entire gameboard.<br><br><br>
      The 4 edge (corner) positions tend to keep going off the edge.  The 2 center positions tend to go up/down.<br><br><br>  
      The female gameboard positions tend to go inward, because they know it's just a game and women tend to kiss and hug more than men.
      Also, any change of direction isn't as obvious as with men.  The movement tends to be more internal.<br><br><br>  
      The "female" gameboard could just as easily be called the "male" gameboard.  We should know both.<br><br><br>  
      I think extroversion goes to the right, introversion to the left.  Each position can be split in half.<br><br><br>
      Also, "going too far" means going off the chart.  Then what?<br><br><br>

      "Suppose you saw this advertisement: <br><br>
      Are you adventurous?  Psychologists studying adventurous carefree people who've led exciting impulsive lives.
      If you're the kind of person who'd do almost anything for a dare and want to participate in a paid experiment ... <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;This ad was written by a psychologist and appeared in several underground newspapers in Boston.  It attracted a number of 
      people who ... fit the clinical picture of an anti-social personality (also called a psychopath or sociopath).  Here is one case 
      that vividly illustrates what can happen when a part of the multimind is absent:  the remainder of the person can develop abnormally.<br> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;The psychologist Elton McNeil described one such person whom he knew ... 'Dan F.'<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;One night, a colleague of Dan's committed suicide.  ... When I did talk to him [Dan], he did not mention the suicide.  Later, when 
      I brought it to his attention, all he could say was that it was 'the way the ball bounces.'  At the station, however, he was
      the one who collected the money for the deceased and presented it personally to the new widow.  As Dan observed, she was really 
      built and had possibilities.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Dan F. had charm plus.  He always seemed to know when to say the right thing with exactly the proper degree of concern, seriousness, 
      and understanding for the benighted victim of a harsh world.  But, he was dead <i>inside</i>."<br><br>
