      gaslighting: a form of manipulation that often occurs in abusive relationships;
      It is a covert (not openly acknowledged or displayed) type of emotional abuse where the bully or abuser misleads the target, 
      creating a false narrative and making them question their judgments and reality.<br><br>

  Humans are <i>too social</i>.  This means many things:
  <br><br>
*  We would rather have negative socializing than none at all.<br>

  Thought experiment:<br><br>
You had a normal childhood.  Then you were abandoned on an island.
  There is enough food and warmth to keep you healthy and you live
  well into your 90s, but you never encounter another human that whole time.
  How will you feel?  Will you be happy?  How?<br><br>

  Believe it or not, there were anti-Nazi Germans in Nazi Germany.  (example: Dietrich Bonhoeffer, killed, 1945)
  There are anti-communists in communist countries.  There are people in India who are against
  the caste system and arranged marriages.  Faceapp, wherever it came from, is a pretty good app and
  $30 a year is a pretty good price.<br><br>
