        So the psychology classmates finally asked Henry, who was actually much older than they were, "Henry, have you figured out 
        your personality type yet?"  Henry replied, "Nope, I haven't committed to anything yet."<br><br>
        That reminds me:  Do you describe large cities with just one personality?  What is New York?  What is Chicago?  What is L.A?  What is Houston?
        What is Miami?  What is Indianapolis?  What is Milwaukee?  What is Detroit?  What is Philadelphia?  What is Mexico City?  What is Toronto?

        Don't make a generalization based on the action of a few individuals who happen to have the means to influence the majority (and to 
        catch the attention of the mass media.)  Despite Disney's latest silly "social move", there are still some good people there. 
        (Bigger group, better chance of finding some good individuals?)  There were Japanese people who were appalled by the bombing of 
        Pearl Harbor.  There were Germans who were anti-Nazi (and persecuted as if they were the enemy.)  There are anti-communists
        living in communist countries.  There are Packer fans in Chicago and Bears fans in Green Bay.  There are Americans who are
        anti-Biden AND anti-Trump!<br><br>

         I think it's ironic that the most self-centered individuals have the biggest "arrows" pointing away from them.  Apparently,
         it takes a lot of people to help an individual be self-centered.<br><br>

         A lot of people who climb the ladder to some top position do so just for the status of it.  When I lived in downtown Sacto
         and Moonbeam got elected, the next day's mini-newspaper-thing-a-ma-bob-you-know-the-type showed a cartoon of Moonbeam
         sitting cross-legged in an observatory-verdana-gazebo-thing at the top of the Capitol building.  He just wanted
         the status.<br><br>

         The problem with the Republican party is that they've never lived up to Lincoln.  By the time they think
