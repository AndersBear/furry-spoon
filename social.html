            &nbsp;&nbsp;Despite never seeing him or that other him in the same room, I've also never seen him get mad, so he can't be that bad.  In 
            factuality, he
            may still be primed to take over the auto-illustrious truck market, but let's not concern ourselves with that right now, but in fact worry about
            the academic economy.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Now the newest technologies, not the ones for spying but for entertaining and experimentation, have the potential to feed
            the doomsayers and the crisis-creators, but fear not, my furry friends, we will have fun, lest we forget our Son of a gun.  <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;How could every era not end in social graces?  After all, we are talking about sociological phenomena.  The wealth
            of a nation, which might also be a book or some other volenty, is, by definitive nature, dependent on many peoples - too many
            for my blood.  Please note, Andy, that I will never be a billionaire, because, if faced with that phenomena, I would do things
            to prevent it.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Andy, please be careful about what you spend your E on reading ... and writing!  Witch brings me to the topic 
            of dis-ease and the Age of Anxiousness.  Is this being written by a human or not?  How can you tell?  Nuffin' against Alan Turing, but 
            he was very smart.  There probably <i>is</i> a sig diff between guys like Turing and guys like J Dahmer.  For God's sake, Dahmer killed 
            his victims.  Turing just raped them.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Surely it is easy to call the era in which you live gregariously unprecedented, what with all the freaky technologies
            floatin' around, although that can be said about plenty of other timestamps.  The ability to read thoughts from afar, wow.  What a concept.
            It's easy to forget the speed of light is 300 million somethings <i>per second</i> ... that's <i>purr second!</i>  Again, why do you
            so quickly doubt this?  That used to perturb me, but now it's just another one of those things.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Now this love letter deserves recognition, authority and Clarice-ification, Han Solobull, you pervert.  Anyway, regarding
            all the ill-useful information in our world, I'd say you <i>can</i> make it through all that<br>
            to come out a natural beast, loving the obnoxiousness, the ridiculous TV shows and the thing you couldn't change with all the 
            money in the future world.  P.S. Write back.<br><br>

             Some people can think while they talk.  They can actually think words different from what they're saying.  Is this a good skill to develop?
             Just like a photographic memory or astral travelling (visualizing leaving the body), when are these types of skills useful?
             I can see how they might haunt you later, if you can't control them.  ("If you don't train your mind, your mind becomes your enemy.")<br><br>
