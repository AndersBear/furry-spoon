      Here is the "female" gameboard, which sits/slides atop the "male" gameboard,
      but I haven't figured out the positions yet.  (I think it goes: negative, neutral, neutral, positive)<br>
      <img src="Chart_other.jpg"></img><br><br>
      possible rough draft:<br>
      <img src="FemaleGameBoard.jpg"></img><br><br>
      The female game board is simpler.  It is linear, the "ranking" goes from left to right.  In other words,
      the middle-right neutral position is better than the middle-left neutral position.
      (-, n, n, +)<br><br><br> 
      Some miscellaneous characteristics:<br><br>
      <img src="Chart_sexy.jpg"></img><br><br>
      Imagine: people are using these ideas to analyze movies.
      <img src="Chart_misc.jpg"></img><br><br><br> 
      Each position can be split, perhaps more than once.  Take the lower left position for example.
      A man is proud to be on the right side of it, but arrogance creeps back in, because
      he thinks that position is the entire gameboard.<br><br><br>
      The 4 edge (corner) positions tend to keep going off the edge.  The 2 center positions tend to go up/down.<br><br><br>  
      The female gameboard positions tend to go inward, because they know it's just a game and women tend to kiss and hug more than men.
      Also, any change of direction isn't as obvious as with men.  The movement tends to be more internal.<br><br><br>
