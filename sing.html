    How do you feel about your favorite band continuing to work right through the death of one of their bandmates?<br><br><br>
    Is it like this:  "If we wait too long, fans will think we'll never be the same." ?  and/or  "If we lose our Numero Uno status, ...
    well, we can't settle for Numero Dos."<br><br><br>  (Neither one makes sense to me, because you can't bring back the deceased and 
    if you like playing music, why worry about what any fans think?) <br><br><br>

           &nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody disputed that these men were the toughest of all men.  As a group, they could plow over anyone who dared
           not worship them, even the cops.  These were the big toughies, "industrial strength everything."  They had the biggest
           trucks, motorcycles and boats.  When they came around, people scattered.  Their women had to give them just the 
           right amount of emotion without ever blowing the lid off the gang.  Bodies <i>and</i> faces were the weapons
           of these toughies toward any stranger who dared look at them the wrong way.  Alcohol and pot were petty to this group.  
           They needed something more powerful.  Cocaine was their
           big deal.  After all, if there were fights among themselves, coke was a required adversary.  As with any other drug, 
           surrounding peer pressure was expected.  Meth-heads were tangent sub-friends of the group.  Then they had this 
           one friend who seemed to have bypassed some of the clan's ways of thinking.  He was intelligent in ways that confused
           most people.  He was more emotional than 
           some of the women, which obviously bothered some of the big studs who were always looking for some pivot point in the 
           conversations.  Most of the men felt secretly betrayed by this guy.  He hadn't paid his dues to them. He hadn't bulked up 
           like they had.  He hadn't cut his hair shorter like they had.  His work wasn't as blue-collar as their work.  
           He listened to rock music, not metal, not country.
           He did more blow than all the others combined and without ever batting an eyelash.  He also did something else that 
           the gang secretly feared.  He did the needle.<br><br>
