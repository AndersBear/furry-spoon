          She pondered marriage.  What was it for?  She knew she wanted kids.  In fact, that was a must-have.
          What kind of man should she seek?  How would the meeting and the courtship go?  Being young, rich and famous, 
          she knew she wasn't the average girl.  She could pretty much have her pick of boys.  Her parents reminded her 
          that she could have any guy she wanted.  Then she pondered just having a child and then getting rid of the father,
          like a praying mantis.  So ... who should she marry?  A rock star!<br><br>
