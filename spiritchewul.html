          "When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death,<br>
            They bound Him and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate, the governor.<br>
            Then Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, repented himself<br>
            and returned the silver to the chief priests and elders,<br>
            saying, 'I have sinned in that I betrayed the innocent Jesus,'<br>
            and Judas went and hung himself."<br><br>

            it is sometimes said,<br>
            took away his quiet pride?<br>
            (What would he have pled?)<br>
            He had joined the chaotic mob ride,<br>
            to death, he let Jesus bled,<br>
            now there was nowhere to hide,<br>
            Pilate committed suicide.<br><br>
