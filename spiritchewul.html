      I am a Christian and a buddhist.  I see Christianity as more of a type of sociology and buddhism as more of a type of psychology.
      There are 3 types of spirits:<br>
      1.  Gods/Goddesses, stay in the afterlife forever<br>
      2.  regular old ghosts, naive innocents who are eventually reborn<br>
      3.  devils, WANT to be reborn, but have an awfully hard time figuring out how, are eventually reborn as very low species (example: dung beetle)<br><br>

      "When first contemplating the possibility of an afterlife, I asked myself,
      'Could the mind continue to live after the body dies?'  I answered yes.
      That seemed like the easy part.  Then I thought about the physical world and I asked myself,

      Even though a spirit doesn't have a physical body,
      it can only view the world from one point at a time.
      A spirit can't see through walls, but the spies can,
      with the help of particle beams.  How are the spies
      affected by doing something that a spirit can't do?
      Furthermore, how are the highly inflated, but hidden
      egos of the spies affected by WHAT they see (or hear or 
      the physical pain they can cause.)  Consider the existence 
      of the secondary means of TELLING their victims - sirens,
      media, etc.<br><br>

      Compromises/Equality/Reincarnation<br><br>
      1.  The lower the species you are reborn as, the more "it's still you." (previouslife/afterlife/self retainment)<br>
      (Humans have a very long childhood.  Why?)<br>
      2.  If you're lucky enough to be reborn as a human, you get to live this life over again.  Yipee.<br>
      (Some spirits may even be able to predict to which human couple they will be reborn, but rebirth is still a selfish mistake.)
      Some people don't want to accept death, but want to skip right to rebirth.  This is obviously an oxymoron.  One must come before the other
      and there might be something in between the two.  Some people are never satisfied, because satisfaction takes a little practice.
      Some people never get enough "good", nor enough "bad" out of life.  Wanting rebirth is more selfish than staying in the afterlife forever,
      but what does that selfishness get you?  More car trouble?<br>
      3.  Gods and Goddesses might live the highest existence, but with who?<br><br>
