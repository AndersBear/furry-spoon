      "When first contemplating the possibility of an afterlife, I asked myself,
      'Could the mind continue to live after the body dies?'  I answered yes.
      That seemed like the easy part.  Then I thought about the physical world and I asked myself,
      'How will you see it?' "<br><br>

      Even though a spirit doesn't have a physical body,
      it can only view the world from one point at a time.
      A spirit can't see through walls, but the spies can,
      with the help of particle beams.  How are the spies
      affected by doing something that a spirit can't do?
      Furthermore, how are the highly inflated, but hidden
      egos of the spies affected by WHAT they see (or hear or 
      the physical pain they can cause?)  Consider the existence 
      of the secondary means of TELLING their victims - sirens,
      media, etc.<br><br>
