               If you're ready to die and you've imagined an afterlife and you're fully prepared for it, nothing can bring you down, SweetCakes.<br><br>
             </div><br><br>   




              <div class="boxed"><br>
              I was reading a magazine article written by a famous person.  He was explaining how he wouldn't have otherwise
                been able to do certain things.  It gave me the weirdest thought: 
                "This article is an apology to an aborted fetus."<br><br>  
                It wasn't really an apology.  It was more like, "This is why I killed you."  Sick stuff.<br><br>  
             </div><br><br>   



              <div class="boxed"><br>
                When asked if He was really the one who "turned the tables" in some riotous outburst that He had never
                even heard about, Jesus replied, 
                "Damn, people are stupider than I thought."<br><br>
              </div><br><br>  
    



              <div class="boxed"><br>
                If there's an afterlife, perhaps the biggest challenge to overcome is the inability to have a physical influence on anyone 
                or anything.  So, thousands of years ago, when religions were first imagined in human minds and written into human history
                (or maybe even before then), the gods, the goddesses and even the devils were pleased.  "Humans are beginning to think about us."<br><br> 
                " ... and leaving a permanent mark!"<br><br>  
              </div><br><br>  



              <div class="boxed"><br>
                It's often hard to imagine that you devils are unhappy.  Even after I've
                written all I could about life and happiness and all that, I suppose
                nobody can do it for you.<br><br>
              </div><br><br>  

    

              <div class="boxed"><br>
                The beginner's mind is full of potential,<br>
                The expert's mind is full of ssssssssssssssssssssomething else.<br><br>
              </div><br><br>  

              <div class="boxed"><br>
                Damned if you do.<br>
                Damned if you don't.<br>
                Damned if you're there.<br>
                Damned if you're not.<br><br>
              </div><br><br>  


              <div class="boxed"><br>
                1.  Satan's best life is human life.  (on this planet)<br>
                2.  Satan's worst life is the afterlife.  (can't handle being alone)<br>
                3.  Being reborn as lower species over and over again is still better than his afterlife.  (can be seen, at least)<br><br>
                Satan worked extremely desperately to be reborn as that worm, but is still miserable.  The way to climb the evolutionary 
                ladder is to give up living as Satan.  (Although he throws it all away in his last life.)<br><br>

               <div class="boxed"><br>
                 I'm starting to understand the tricky way that some people are deliberately misunderstanding buddhism.  They're
                 trying to get Buddha on their side.  Buddha, like Jesus, is not on your side.  For what do you need someone on your side?<br><br>

               <div class="boxed"><br>
                 Buddha's father helped him develop his theory that desire is a cause of unhappiness.  Buddha's father was a king.<br><br>
