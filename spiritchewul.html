          "When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death,<br>
            They bound Him and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate, the governor.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;"After the human version of Satan became convinced of the existence of an afterlife and that he would be invisible after his 
            most recent physical body died,
            he also convinced himself that his afterlife would be fast and painless.  Sadly for him, his afterlife is longer and more tortuous than even
            he could've imagined.   After having such an intense influence on so many people, it was now perfectly impossible to have a direct influence
            on any living thing.
            All he could do was <i>recognize</i> evil.  He could think, 'There it is,' or 'That's me!'  If he tried to reach out his hand and touch anything,
            he would realize that he didn't <i>have</i> a hand (physically).<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; He counted the last moments of his afterlife or what he thought were the last moments.  Sadly for him again, the pain continued as if 
            it would never end, just like the last years of his physical existence.  He found himself hanging around the lowest species and wondering which
            one he would be reborn as, since he was hell-bent on being reborn.  (Is rebirth as a rodent considered a success?)
            All the terrifying memories, however, would stay in his mind after being reborn.  He just couldn't win.  He refused to win.  'Redefine it,'
            he thought.<br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the lowest living things are the easiest to kill, regarding feelings of guilt afterward.  In fact, we should feel
            a tiny bit of pride killing Satan, shouldn't we?  After all, the lowest species know all about the cycle of death and rebirth and we might be
            saving innocent and defenseless other living things.  Of course there is a ranking among all living things, relative to humans, isn't there?  
            Is a redwood tree more valuable than a shark?  A monkey more valuable than a yeast?  A stalk of corn more valuable than a dung beetle?"<br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;The mendrills had programmed the chimpan-Zees, which took a long time, because the chimps were so numerous.  Then the mendrills 
            programmed the gorillas, which took alot of effort and some fearful nights, given the humongoidal size of the G's bodies, except for one 
            part.  The mendrills also programmed the orangutangs, all the generic primates and even the bats, but this way of looking at the setting 
            in the deep, dark jungle was just a common opinion, a delusion, actually.  It was as if atheists had created their own religion, which, 
            of course, had gradually turned into Satanism, because they had indeed singled out just one mendrill, and then they were dissatisfied
            with what they had created.  Almost completely unaware of this ridiculousness, that one lucky mendrill fell asleep.  The storytelling Satanists 
            would have to find another one.<br><br>
