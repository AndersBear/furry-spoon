       "Nice car,<br>
        I love those Bavarians,<br>
        so meticulous,<br>
        I remember a time<br>
        when things were a lot more fun around here,<br>
        when good was good<br>
        and evil was evil,<br>
        before things got so ... fuzzy,<br>
        I was once a golden boy like you,<br>
        I was summoned to the halls of power <br>
        in the heavenly court<br>
        and I dined with the deities<br>
        who looked upon me with favor<br>
        for my talents,<br>
        my creativity,<br>
        We sat beneath the palms<br>
        in the warm afternoon<br>
        and drank the wine<br>
        with Fitzgerald and Huxley,<br>
        They pawned a biting phrase,<br>
        from tongues hot with blood<br>
        and drained their pens of bitter ink,<br>
        vainly reaching for the bottle of empty Edens,<br>
        branded specially for the ones<br>
        who had come with great expectations<br>
        to the perfumed halls of Allah<br>
        for their time in the sun,<br>
        We were stokin' the fires<br>
        and oilin' up the machinery<br>
        until the gods found out <br>
        we had ideas of our own,<br>
        and the war was coming,<br>
        the earth was shaking,<br>
        and there was no more room,"<br><br>
       ~  Corey, Paul Gurian, Henley, Lynch (?),  "The Garden of Allah"<br><br>

    <div class="boxed"><br>
      With enough practice<br>
      acknowledging his existence,<br>
      at every happy moment,<br>
      every success,<br>
      at the beginning of every new phase,<br>
      every old phase,<br>
      when you least expect it,<br>
      or when you predict it,<br> 
      Satan is just a tiny pin prick.<br><br>

              <div class="boxed"><br>
                If there's an afterlife, perhaps the biggest challenge to overcome is the inability to have a physical influence on anyone 
                or anything.  So, thousands of years ago, when religions were first imagined in human minds and written into human history
                (or maybe even before then), the gods, the goddesses and even the devils were pleased.  "Humans are beginning to think about us."<br><br> 
                " ... and leaving a permanent mark!"<br><br>  
              </div><br><br>  



              <div class="boxed"><br>
                It's often hard to imagine that you devils are unhappy.  Even after I've
                written all I could about life and happiness and all that, I suppose
                nobody can do it for you.<br><br>
              </div><br><br>  

    


              <div class="boxed"><br>
                1.  Satan's best life is human life.  (on this planet)<br>
                2.  Satan's worst life is the afterlife.  (can't handle being alone)<br>
                3.  Being reborn as lower species over and over again is still better than his afterlife.  (can be seen, at least)<br><br>
                Satan worked extremely desperately to be reborn as that worm, but is still miserable.  The way to climb the evolutionary 
                ladder is to give up living as Satan.  (Although he throws it all away in his last life.)<br><br>
                God's (and Goddess's) best life is the afterlife, because that's their only one.<br><br>

               <div class="boxed"><br>
                 I'm starting to understand the tricky way that some people are deliberately misunderstanding buddhism.  They're
                 trying to get Buddha on their side.  Buddha, like Jesus, is not on your side.  For what do you need someone on your side?<br><br>

               <div class="boxed"><br>
                 Buddha's father helped him develop his theory that desire is a cause of unhappiness.  Buddha's father was a king.<br><br>

               <div class="boxed"><br>
                 The people living around Joe and Mary in their later years desperately pondered whether or not Joe and Mary had ever had sex.  
                 The people
                 finally came to the conclusion that the marriage was indeed sexless and, as usual, the people found a problem with that.<br><br>

                 Even Jesus wouldn't have let you play scapegoat forever.<br><br>
