      I am a Christian and a buddhist.  I see Christianity as more of a type of sociology and buddhism as more of a type of psychology.
      There are 3 types of spirits:<br>
      1.  Gods/Goddesses, stay in the afterlife forever<br>
      2.  regular old ghosts, naive innocents who are eventually reborn<br>
      3.  devils, WANT to be reborn, but have an awfully hard time figuring out how, are eventually reborn as very low species (example: dung beetle)<br><br>

      Mr. T knows one of the thoughts that a God/Goddess has about evil humans:  "I pity the fool!"<br>
      On the other hand, he might never mention this, because he's a big, tough brute,
      but the Gods'/Goddesses' thought about good humans is:  "I love you." &#128525; <br><br>

      1.  The lower the species you are reborn as, the more "it's still you." (previouslife/afterlife/self retainment)<br>
      (Humans have a very long childhood.  Why?)<br>
      2.  If you're lucky enough to be reborn as a human, you get to live this life over again.  Yipee.<br>
      (Some spirits may even be able to predict to which human couple they will be reborn, but rebirth is still a selfish mistake.)
      Some people don't want to accept death, but want to skip right to rebirth.  This is obviously an oxymoron.  One must come before the other
      and there might be something in between the two.  Some people are never satisfied, because satisfaction takes a little practice.
      Some people never get enough "good", nor enough "bad" out of life.  Wanting rebirth is more selfish than staying in the afterlife forever,
      but what does that selfishness get you?  More car trouble?<br>
      3.  Gods and Goddesses might live the highest existence, but with who?<br><br>
