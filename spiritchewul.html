              I was reading a magazine article written by a famous person.  He was explaining how he wouldn't have otherwise
                been able to do certain things.  It gave me the weirdest thought: 
                "This article is an apology to an aborted fetus."<br><br>  
                It wasn't really an apology.  It was more like, "This is why I killed you."  Sick stuff.<br><br>

              <div class="boxed"><br>
                When asked if He was really the one who "turned the tables" in some riotous outburst that He had never
                even heard about, Jesus replied, 
                "Damn, people are stupider than I thought."<br><br>

                The potential for a pleasant rebirth<br>
                might seem to have much more worth,<br>
                forever is too long of a time,<br>
                pointless on the number line,<br>
                if human, who will you be?<br>

                between cynicism and buddhism,<br>
                but once you see the difference,<br>
                you realize that one goes to the extreme<br>

                &nbsp;&nsbp;"Thinking again of my former professor in this light, it is easy to see that he wasn't exactly the poster boy
                for happy workers.  While a brilliant scholar, prolific writer, and accomplished researcher, he was known
                for being cranky, impatient, overly demanding and generally disliked.  Many of his grad students dreaded working
                with him. ... <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;In the very same department, however, worked another professor whom I have thought of many times over the years.
                This man was certainly less accomplished than his colleagues and enjoyed little professional recognition. ... There was no 
                doubt that this man was unlikely to make any great new discoveries ... But he had a talent for teaching.  He had a way
                of connecting with his students, inspiring many to take a genuine interest in chemistry ... His grad students worshipped him
                and he became a mentor to many of them ... I am certain I'm not alone in remembering him fondly many years later.  It is easy 
                to guess which professor enjoyed a happier life, at work as well as at home."<br><br>
