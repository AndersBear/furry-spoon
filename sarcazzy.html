            &nbsp;&nbsp;I was at a bar having a long conversation with a man who quietly revealed himself as a spy.  He rattled off all the things he 
            knew about me.
            He said, "I know where you live, all your previous addresses and phone numbers, all your acquaintances.  
            I know all the websites you go to and all your passwords.
            I know what color underwear you're going to wear tomorrow.  I know what's in every room of your apartment.  I know everything you've done for 
            not only the last five years, but your entire life.  I know who you've had sex with.  I know your car inside and out.  I know what you type 
            into your computer.  I've recorded all your conversations for the last 25 years.  I even know your most intimate thoughts."<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I asked him, "So why'd you finally hunt me down?"<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "I wanted to give you a good scolding about all the things you get away with!"<br><br>

            I've read about philosophies that guide you to be independent, but I've never heard about any

             So I've assessed the value of my possessions.  Car, of course, is worth more to me than its resale value, because of 
             all the work I've had done to it, although it can be a liability for that same reason in the future.  Musical instruments, equal to their
             resale value.  Computers, aha!  Worth much more than their resale value, because of all the time I've spent collecting those
             nudey vids.<br><br>

             If I walk slower, will I have a better chance of meeting "The One"?  I usually walk fast.  It's just a habit.  I know I don't have
             any chance of meeting Ray Davies.<br><br>
