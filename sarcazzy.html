     Spying on me has become an automatic thing for some people.  They depend on it - their mood for the day, 
       their conversations, all kinds of things.  And it's all about feeling, you know.  
       It's an addiction.  I laugh about it, so they think it's okay. I'm like their little pet.  Apparently, if
       the government is doing  it, it's exquisitely legal.  Anyway, it sometimes makes me think twice,
       like I should be concerned about every move I make.  If I leave my curtains closed for too long,
       the spies think I'm sulking.  They probably get mad.  It makes me worry about who I might see the next time I go out.<br><br>

        frightened by some old guy in a bathrobe and slippers.  As he approached me in the hall, he had that
        permafrown look on his face and his eyes were fixed on me.  He stopped in front of me and scoldingly blurted out,

        So I've been having sex with a very intriguing woman for a few weeks now.  She told me she would like a few quickies
          in the coming days.  She burst into my apartment just now and we did some really wild things.  It was all over in three minutes.
          As we were talking afterward, she casually mentioned a guy who she had sex with in the "distant past" and I swear I wouldn't have
          been so grossed out if she hadn't been talking about 10 minutes ago.<br><br>
