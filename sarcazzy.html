            &nbsp;&nbsp;I was at a bar having a long conversation with a man who quietly revealed himself as a spy.  He rattled off all the things he 
            knew about me.
            He said, "I know where you live, all your previous addresses and phone numbers, all your acquaintances.  
            I know all the websites you go to and all your passwords.
            I know what color underwear you're going to wear tomorrow.  I know what's in every room of your apartment.  I know everything you've done for 
            not only the last five years, but your entire life.  I know who you've had sex with.  I know your car inside and out.  I know what you type 
            into your computer.  I've recorded all your conversations for the last 25 years.  I even know your most intimate thoughts."<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I asked him, "So why'd you finally hunt me down?"<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "I wanted to give you a good scolding about all the things you get away with!"<br><br>

            So I'm in medical school, right, and they call me into the operating room, because there's nobody else to do the operation.
            I look at everyone and say, "I'm sorry.  I don't know a thing about this operation.  I cheated on this part in class."  The guy dies
            right after I say that.  Uh-oh.<br><br>
          </div><br><br> 

          <div class="boxed"><br>
            You heard this joke already.  How sad.<br><br>

          <div class="boxed"><br>
            Whenever I write about some new idea or thought, the next 14 people I see in media tell me they don't approve.<br><br>

          <div class="boxed"><br>
            Now this one is the epitome of the tricky, techno-sick times we live in:  I hear loud banging on my door.  I open the door
            and this big, angry, ugly guy throws a book at me and yells, "I wrote your autobiography!"<br><br>
            Think about how weird that is. That's my life.<br><br>
            Picture this:  Every time you open your curtains, there's a bunch of people standing immediately on the other side of the window
            staring at you and blowing cigarette smoke at you.  I mean, they don't even make a joke out of it.  They're serious ... about ... something?<br><br>

            There is rootkit spyware on just about all of the big corporate servers.  The network admin is saying, "Look, it just works, okay?"<br><br>
