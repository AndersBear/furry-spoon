            &nbsp;&nbsp;I was at a bar having a long conversation with a man who quietly revealed himself as a spy.  He rattled off all the things he 
            knew about me.
            He said, "I know where you live, all your previous addresses and phone numbers, all your acquaintances.  
            I know all the websites you go to and all your passwords.
            I know what color underwear you're going to wear tomorrow.  I know what's in every room of your apartment.  I know everything you've done for 
            not only the last five years, but your entire life.  I know who you've had sex with.  I know your car inside and out.  I know what you type 
            into your computer.  I've recorded all your conversations for the last 25 years.  I even know your most intimate thoughts."<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I asked him, "So why'd you finally hunt me down?"<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "I wanted to give you a good scolding about all the things you get away with!"<br><br>

             I told the bawler dude I was gonna try to concentrate my attention a little more on the older women, because
             all of the younger women are obviously beautiful.  He told me that the ratio of attractive-to-unattractive is 90/10
             before they're 40 and 10/90 after they're 40.  (Should I scold him?)<br><br>

              Another says, "I'm having a boy because I was on bottom when he was conceived."<br>
              The third woman starts crying.<br>
