          I often don't know what to say in the simplest situations.  Someone tells me, "I like your shirt."
          I say, "Thanks, I worked really hard on it."<br><br>

          Facial expressions seem different during the holidays.  Alot of creepy guys come out.  It scares me
          and makes me wonder how people meet.  I bet a lot of women feel the same way as I do about this, but 
          they think it's just better to be married to one of those guys.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp; We were having a conversation about music, a favorite subject of mine, but it was turning into
          one of those typical, subliminally metaphorical conversations.  I don't normally enjoy that type of talk,
          except when the subliminal subject is sex.  <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Anywho, I mentioned that I wasn't a big fan of singing and she seemed to get a little upset.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, so all I do is sing, huh?  It's so easy, huh?" she spoke rather snidely.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;"No," I said.  "It isn't like that.  I know it's really hard and you really have
          developed your skill very well.  I just wish you'd pick up an instrument once in awhile."<br><br>

       There's this guy who talks to me whenever he feels sad or mad so that he can accuse me of being sad or mad.
