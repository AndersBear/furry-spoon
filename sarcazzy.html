            &nbsp;&nbsp;I was at a bar having a long conversation with a man who quietly revealed himself as a spy.  He rattled off all the things he 
            knew about me.
            He said, "I know where you live, all your previous addresses and phone numbers, all your acquaintances.  
            I know all the websites you go to and all your passwords.
            I know what color underwear you're going to wear tomorrow.  I know what's in every room of your apartment.  I know everything you've done for 
            not only the last five years, but your entire life.  I know who you've had sex with.  I know your car inside and out.  I know what you type 
            into your computer.  I've recorded all your conversations for the last 25 years.  I even know your most intimate thoughts."<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I asked him, "So why'd you finally hunt me down?"<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "I wanted to give you a good scolding about all the things you get away with!"<br><br>

            So I'm in medical school, right, and they call me into the operating room, because there's nobody else to do the operation.
            I look at everyone and say, "I'm sorry.  I don't know a thing about this operation.  I cheated on this part in class."  The guy dies
            right after I say that.  Uh-oh.<br><br>

            Now this one is the epitome of the tricky, techno-sick times we live in:  I hear loud banging on my door.  I open the door
            and this big, angry, ugly guy throws a book at me and yells, "I wrote your autobiography!"<br><br>
            Think about how weird that is. That's my life.<br><br>
            Picture this:  Every time you open your curtains, there's a bunch of people standing immediately on the other side of the window
            staring at you and blowing cigarette smoke at you.  I mean, they don't even make a joke out of it.  They're serious ... about ... something?<br><br>

            Back in the 1990s, the "I.T." departments often ran batch programs overnight.  These programs would accumulate all the 
            business transactions that occurred that day and update customer records.  If the overnight batch program would crash,
            the system would start calling the on-call I.T. workers.  If one worker couldn't figure out the problem, he or she would
            get the next on-call person on the line.  Sometimes half a dozen or more workers would be on the conference call trying to figure out the
            problem at 3:00 in the morning.  After a couple hours on the phone, they might suspect that the problem was not in the code logic.
            Obviously if the system was directly connected to an external network, they would consider that it had been hacked.  There are all
            kinds of different frustrations they had to consider.  They might suspect that one of them knows the problem, but is not talking about 
            it, for some tricky reason.  They might suspect that one of the networkers deliberately planted a bug.  
            They might figure out some workaround and eventually time would run out and they would meet at their 
            workplace.  It was pretty rough.  At the end of the conference call, it made them even more frustrated if one of them said 
            something like, "I've enjoyed this."<br><br>

            So I'm reading a men's magazine article about sexual practices.  The writers were asking women about preferences and turn-offs 
            and alot of the women
            were saying that the one thing they don't like is when a guy has anal sex with them without asking first. I can just imagine the 
            writers thinking, "Let's see if we can get one of these women to talk about anal sex <i>without asking them!</i>"<br><br>
