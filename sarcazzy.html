     It's 2049.  My joke about having a harem has been popular for many years now.  Various men and animals have been added to it.  
       The public has gone along with the joke, but few people know the real truth.  Some other studs and I trade
       harems once in awhile.  Eight of the women in my harem are pregnant.  It's hard to keep track of the chaos.  I'm not the biological
       father, so people ask how the women got pregnant.  The answer, of course, which is the same answer as to how Jesus 
       was conceived, is very simple:  a turkey baster.<br><br>
