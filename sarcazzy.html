          "One of the youngest spies was trying to bring back phone-tapping as a buzztrend.  The other spies might like it, but
          they also might see it as too easy or too much of an escape.  If any spy spies for too long,
          he starts to get wishy-washy about identity.  In other words, the spy thought he was me.  Remembering a recent
          phone conversation I had, I found the rare opportunity 
          to say something to the spy and I took it by saying, 'Now go do what my mom told you to do.' "<br><br>

           &nbsp;&nbsp;A guy with a harem of girlfriends was talking to one of the girlfriends.  She was a bit upset.<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a chauvinist.  You have all these girlfriends, but if we see any other man, you're not interested in us anymore.
           You treat us like slaves, like robots, like <i>playthings</i>!"<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;The guy starts walking away.  She gets more upset.<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are you going?!?!" she yells.<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;The man replies, "I have better things to do."<br><br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;I was at a bar having a long conversation with a man who quietly revealed himself as a spy.  He rattled off all the things he 
            knew about me.
            He said, "I know where you live, all your previous addresses and phone numbers, all your acquaintances.  
            I know all the websites you go to and all your passwords.
            I know what color underwear you're going to wear tomorrow.  I know what's in every room of your apartment.  I know everything you've done for 
            not only the last five years, but your entire life.  I know who you've had sex with.  I know your car inside and out.  I know what you type 
            into your computer.  I've recorded all your conversations for the last 25 years.  I even know your most intimate thoughts."<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I asked him, "So why'd you finally hunt me down?"<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "I wanted to give you a good scolding about all the things you get away with!"<br><br>

            I can sometimes understand the most complicated concepts, but I sometimes mess up the most basic concepts.  For example, 
            when they say "Trump", I hear "Biden" and when they say "Biden", I hear "Trump."<br><br>

            So I's watching the liberal channel and some guy is goin' on and on about how sick DonDon is and I agree 100%.  He's got 
            dissociative personality disorder or whatever and a bunch of other problems, but don't feel sorry for him.  He's a 
            <i>made</i> man.  He <i>made</i> himself sick.  Like I always say, the sickest people are those who <i>made</i> themselves
            sick.  Call in Pacino and DeNiro and those other actors 'cuz I think it's time for another Mafia movie.<br><br>
            (Also, you can interchange Trump and Biden with very little needed adjustments.)<br><br>
