       &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm actually not a big fan of sarcasm, because too often it's only a disguise for derision.  I'll
       leave that to the late-night ghosts.  What kind of humor do I like?  Self-humiliation is pertty good.
       Rodney Dangerfield - love him.  Ray Romano, Michael McDonald, Key & Peele.  Sarah Silverman has had 
       some catchy stuff.  Chelsea Handler - there's something in her.  Michelle Wolf - definitely love her.  
       Steven Wright - there's obviously some 
       intelligence there, if he could just stop smoking dope for five minutes. <br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;Humor is essential in almost all areas of life.  They don't have to laugh or even smile,
       but there's a difference between faces that could easily break into smiles at any moment and faces
       that never do.  Howard Stern, vulgar, but has a huge social impact (NYC) and social know-how.  Sam Kinison
       was good, if you can hear past the screaming.  Louie Anderson, love.  SNL has produced some greats.  (volatile,
       again - NYC).  I love impressions and sounds.  Caliendo/Winslow.  Eddie Murphy, extroverted, wants people to 
       talk more.  Kevin Hart, short, so there ya go.  Built-in funny.  That Julio guy.  Leno, Fallon, Shaq.  
       Garry Shandling.  Larry Adam Sanders.  James Harden.  Will Ferrell.  The Nerds.<br> 
       &nbsp;&nbsp;I don't get much into politics.  James Austin Johnson has the difficult job of impersonating
       a bad joke.  I like puppets/muppets and some animation.  Reno911 - awesome.  The Office - no laughtrack, 
       that's a big plus for me.  I hope the future involves plenty
       of the Disney kids.  They'll bring yet another new style.<br><br>

      Three 30-something dudes were reminiscing about their previous bachelor lifestyles.<br><br>
      ding-a-ling#1:  "You know, you guys, I didn't actually get married.  I thought about it for a long time
      and couldn't quite understand why anybody would.  I guess the woman wants it, like a legal thing or something.
      So we didn't actually make it by law.  We just had the ceremony and signed a fake document."<br><br>
      ding-a-ling#2:  "Oh, I know.  I didn't actually do it, either.  It's a legal thing, like a financial thing.  Luckily, my wife and I both
      agreed on it."<br><br> 
      ding-a-ling#3:  "Damn."<br><br>
