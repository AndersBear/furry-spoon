      "Thirty-six-year-old David Griffiths was expelled from the Twickenham branch of the Conservative Association in 1995 because his
       views were considered too right wing.  Griffiths told a meeting in August of that year that he favoured the death penalty for all 
       crimes, that homosexuals should be encouraged to commit suicide and that people who claim social security should gun each other 
       down on the street.  Griffiths returned to politics a year later when he ran for the Twickenham seat in the 1996 General Election 
       as the Antichirst.  He said that he had been aware that he was the Antichrist for some time, but had kept quiet about it in case 
       it damaged his career in the Conservative Party."<br><br>
