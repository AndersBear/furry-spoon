      So I watched the "J. Edgar" movie.  Here was one thought:
      Tolson was a good guy who couldn't stop Hoover from being a bad one.  
      Tolson wanted to be good, anyway.  He was just a gay cop.<br>
      (Secretary Gandy couldn't stop him, either.)  Extreme determination?<br><br>

      You probly heard this one already:<br><br>
      A teacher asks the class, "Who wrote The Declaration of Independence?"<br>
      She calls on Johnny.<br>
      Johnny says, "I don't know and I don't give a damn."<br>
      The teacher gets angry and drags Johnny into the principal's office.<br>
      "Principal, listen to this:  Johnny, who wrote The Declaration of Independence?"<br>
      Johnny says, "I don't know and I don't give a damn."<br>
      The principal gets angry and calls in Johnny's daddy.<br>
      The principal says, "Daddy, listen to this:  Johnny, who wrote The Declaration of Independence?"<br> 
      For a third time, Johnny says, "I don't know and I don't give a damn."<br>
      Seeing that the teacher and principal are angrily looking at him to do something,<br> 
      the daddy says to Johnny, "Damn it, boy, if you done it, you better 'fess up to it."<br><br>

      A man at a restaurant ordered soup.  The waiter had his thumb in the soup when he served it.  The man angrily said, 
      "Why is your thumb in my soup?!"  The waiter said, "My doctor told me to keep my sore thumb in a warm place."  The 
      man got even angrier and said, "Why don't you shove your thumb up your ass!"  Nonetheless, the man decided to accept the soup
      and as he was swallowing his first sip, the waiter answered, "Oh, I do that when I'm back in the kitchen."<br><br>
