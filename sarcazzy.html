      are indeed threatened by people who don't want secrets revealed.  On a lighter note, if my

    "Alot of comedians get ahead because they work with a big singer and they get in good with him
      and then the big singer takes them to all the jobs, you know. I worked with a big singer
      and tried to get in good with him, but it didn't work out.  One night in his room, they
      had a party.  I went over to him and said, 'If people are bothering you, maybe I could give 
      you a hand and keep people out of your room.'
      He told me to keep out of his room."<br><br>
