      The cops/FF/spies/etc. can easily make a city seem like a terrible place by yelping their sirens and feeding the 
      news channels ridiculously made-up stories.  In fact, it's probably gotten to be very effortless to do.  They can make Eau Claire, WI 
      seem terrible simply by reporting to the reporters that there was a triple murder. Or how about that classic story about some old
      guy who drives through a county fair and kills eight people because he thought the gas pedal was the brake?  Hey, if a whole town is sleeping, ... <br><br>

      "There was much speculation about whether it was a murder or a suicide.  It hardly occurred to anyone
      to think that it might've been a fake death.  In a vehicle carrying the body, perhaps
      an ambulance, perhaps a hearse, Tom suddenly 'came alive' and they celebrated like in 
      that scene in the movie 'Wild Things.'  Meanwhile, the coroner's main job was to rule out
      suicide.  That would've blown the insurance money.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;With hard physical evidence a firm part of the story, they considered themselves geniuses, just as they still do
      with all the fascinating SpyTech.  Connecting the sound of the sirens to the bodily functions of the spied victims
      was absolutely amazing, literally breathtaking.  With years of persistence, they were going to transform neighborhoods.
      When the mass media increased their use of SpyTech, the chaos was exhilirating."<br><br>
