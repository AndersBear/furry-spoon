      The cops/FF/spies/etc. can easily make a city seem like a terrible place by yelping their sirens and feeding the 
      news channels ridiculously made-up stories.  In fact, it's probably gotten to be very effortless to do.  They can make Eau Claire, WI 
      seem terrible simply by reporting to the reporters that there was a triple murder. Or how about that classic story about some old
      guy who drives through a county fair and kills eight people because he thought the gas pedal was the brake?  Hey, if a whole town is sleeping, ...

      "There was much speculation about whether it was a murder or a suicide.  It hardly occurred to anyone
      to think that it might've been a fake death.  In a vehicle carrying the body, perhaps
      an ambulance, perhaps a hearse, Tom suddenly 'came alive' and they celebrated like in 
      that scene in the movie 'Wild Things.'  Meanwhile, the coroner's main job was to rule out
      suicide.  That would've blown the insurance money.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;With hard physical evidence a firm part of the story, they considered themselves geniuses, just as they still do
      with all the fascinating SpyTech.  Connecting the sound of the sirens to the bodily functions of the spied victims
      was absolutely amazing, literally breathtaking.  With years of persistence, they were going to transform neighborhoods.
      When the mass media increased their use of SpyTech, the chaos was exhilirating."<br><br>

         *  planned coincidence<br>
         *  picking fights from afar, because of the life choices you made or because you feel that your victims have prevented you from
            being happy, but then, when the gate opens ... RETREAT!  (see Twitter video about dogs/fence)<br>

        3 philosophies about SpyTech:<br><br>
           1.  Fight fire with fire.  Obviously bad.<br><br>
           2.  Block the signal.  Good.<br><br>
           3.  Reverse the signal.  Can be deceptively similar to 1, so do it legally.  For example, do you fully own the land on which you live?<br><br>
           (honorable mention:  When it comes to law, there are always tricky loopholes.  Also, sometimes a good human gets executed while a bad human goes free.)<br><br>

           &nbsp;&nbsp;The closeted spies want to set me up with their female victims who are somehow connected to me.
           If you look at my Instagram followers, some of the faces are from Facebook.  It's the usual 
           identity trick.  (Although some of those accounts might also be the actual people just having fun.  ðŸ˜‰  Hey, these are the days!)
           What are their motives?  The closeted spies 
           are experts at occupying the line between bad and bad.  They want the best (worst?) of both worlds.
           They proudly consider themselves "perfect bisexuals", but
           everyone knows that doesn't last, especially with men, because it's just a "time and place" thing.  
           ("bi now, gay later")  Still, they're very good at the concepts of two's and three's.  
           Forget the concept of "one".  That's out of the question.  The closeted spies are the most dependent of all people.
           They might appear to be loners (because of the notoriety?) or to be asexual, but SpyTech has given them a huge boost
           (or a huge setback?) in prolonging their delusional ways of thinking.
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these tricks can be categorized, at least philosophically.  Spying, usually by definition,
           is a "closeted" action - secretive - but the spies proudly enjoy multi-tasking and taking risks.  They want to 
           maintain two or more concepts in their minds at the same time.  What is a more important and binary 
           subject than sex?  The closeted spy wants a threesome with me and his female victim, because he really wants just me.
           The female in that case is just a third-party pawn.
           (They know that a threesome with me and another man would be impossible to visualize with me in it.)
           What could be better than one big ego than two big egos?  Further still, what better to do with a catalog of victims than
           to rank the ones you want to abuse the most?
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Masculinity (sexuality) is a detail that I've noticed in the spies' desires.  For example,
           when I posted alot of music or when I'm adjusting my Spotify playlists, they seem to like white male artists.
           The spies will communicate to me whenever I so much as look at any other type of human - female, black, Asian, etc.,
           although the communication is usually a "yesno", like dogs barking at anything and everything.
           (Again, this is about the lowest level stuff - men who have determinedly de-evolved since Day One.)<br><br>

           &nbsp;&nbsp;"This was their first time using the SpyTech to torture one of the expert nuisance spies, although it had been done years before by other countries.
           It couldn't be well-documented, for obvious reasons.  The only difficult part was getting the expert nuisance to agree to wear the device.
           They coaxed him into it surprisingly easily after praising his spying skills and telling him that the device would only increase his powers.
           Now every time he thought certain thoughts, ZAP!, the device remotely triggered the noisemaker, barely prodding him 
           with a tiny electrical spark.  He got used to it quickly.<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;However, it took much longer for him to figure out that now he <i>couldn't</i> stop the sound even if he tried.  
           In other words, he couldn't control the device, because he couldn't control his thoughts.  This particular device had logging 
           and tracking capabilities, of course, but they weren't needed with this guy.  After several 
           decades of using SpyTech, which had inevitably included VR headsets and bi-directional, pain-inducing particle beams, 
           he was already half dead.  In fact, the torture was now being deployed wirelessly, without any device."<br><br>

           denied that it was being used in SpyTech had minds that were still learning and vibrant and therefore still vulnerable.

               Some people completely deny all the SpyTech and how all the mass media is connected to it,<br>
               so much that they completely avoid me.  (in person, especially?)<br><br>

               Spies love secret messages.<br><br>
             </div><br><br>  


             <div class="boxed"><br>
               After realizing all the various SpyTech ways, including the infliction of pain on their victims, two firefighters
               were talking to each other:<br>
               FF1 (coercive):  "You're taking yourself off the on-call list?  What if there's a really big emergency?"<br>
               FF2 (reluctant):  "Ehh, I just can't make it."<br><br>
             </div><br><br>  

             <div class="boxed"><br>
               I didn't watch much of the movie "J. Edgar", just the kissing scene and one other scene - the one with the politician,
               maybe the president, idk, but he's sitting at his desk, facing the camera, thinking about how to deal with a particularly
               difficult colleague, thinking, thinking, thinking ... thinking ... thinking ... thinking.  Finally, he says, "Get me J. Edgar Hoover."
               Having learned about spying and the minds of spies in the last few years, I knew exactly what he meant.  Had to giggle.<br><br>  
             </div><br><br>  

             <div class="boxed"><br>
               So I read this book by Joseph Persico, "Roosevelt's Secret War" and there was this phrase repeated many times, whenever anybody
               angered The Feds or the FBI or the spies:  " ... and he was put under electronic surveillance."  It seemed like
               every other paragraph ended with that phrase for at least three chapters.<br><br>
             </div><br><br>  



              <div class="boxed"><br>
                One good use of SpyTech, when it's actually used by the few good individuals who know what "good" means, 
                is that there will never be another military draft.  ("A spy is worth 20,000 soldiers.")  One bad, but perhaps amusing use of it might be
                ... movies about your girlfriend!<br><br>

              <div class="boxed"><br>
                The spies had a group meeting.  They were discussing thought-reading technology and feeling like they couldn't
                let it become publicly understood.  They lamented the future and how they (and the technology) probably would
                never be perfectly isolated.  They felt they needed protection and to work together as a close group.<br>
                "We need to use this technology more extensively so that we can learn how to scare people away from using it," one spy proclaimed.<br>
                "Yes, indeed.  We could probably do that, too, using only our thoughts," said another.<br>
                "We just need somewhere to work and to live.  You know working from home is more common these days.  Plus, we could
                provoke the people into spying on us and then bust them for using such powerful technology against us."  They were
                learning all the tricks that come with tricky technology.<br>
                "Yes, let's agree that we need a place to live," one spy suggested, somewhat romantically.<br>
                "We're best together.  Where will we live?  We need to settle our minds in order to make the technology work and to get
                the best audio/video reception.  Should we live in the desert?  In the mountains?  Underwater?  Should we live in a hut or 
                a tall building or a tent or maybe an igloo?"  They pondered.<br>
                The romantically-inclined spy had the answer.<br>
                He soberingly said, "I think I know where we're going to end up living."<br>
                "Where?" they all asked.<br>
                "In a coma."<br><br>

                They listen to their victim's thoughts because they fear their own.  ("I'm G-G-Gay.")<br><br>

                I would divulge in bizarre, seemingly intense, irrationally over-reactive behavior and be stricken with stomach-sickening
                guilt for three days afterward.  (Ma's side of the family is Catholic.)  I realized a funny thing.  The people who 
                witnessed my ill madness enjoyed it.  It sparked something in their otherwise dull routine.  They somehow knew
                I wouldn't do much harm.  I <i>could've</i> done damage, because anyone can do damage, but they knew 
                this particular freak wouldn't.
                Some of them were even disappointed.  Nonetheless, I learned to hone the radical behavior, 
                which also decreases the feeling of guilt.<br><br>

                The spies like to sound their message at the moment I wake up.  I haven't figured
                this one out yet.  ("I'll say when.")<br><br>
                Maybe they catch themselves falling in love with me at that moment.  It's an
                interesting moment.  My thoughts are usually going wild right before I wake up.
