      The cops/FF/spies/etc. can easily make a city seem like a terrible place by yelping their sirens and feeding the 
      news channels ridiculously made-up stories.  In fact, it's probably gotten to be very effortless to do.  They can make Eau Claire, WI 
      seem terrible simply by reporting to the reporters that there was a triple murder. Or how about that classic story about some old
      guy who drives through a county fair and kills eight people because he thought the gas pedal was the brake?  Hey, if a whole town is sleeping, ... <br><br>

      "There was much speculation about whether it was a murder or a suicide.  It hardly occurred to anyone
      to think that it might've been a fake death.  In a vehicle carrying the body, perhaps
      an ambulance, perhaps a hearse, Tom suddenly 'came alive' and they celebrated like in 
      that scene in the movie 'Wild Things.'  Meanwhile, the coroner's main job was to rule out
      suicide.  That would've blown the insurance money.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;With hard physical evidence a firm part of the story, they considered themselves geniuses, just as they still do
      with all the fascinating SpyTech.  Connecting the sound of the sirens to the bodily functions of the spied victims
      was absolutely amazing, literally breathtaking.  With years of persistence, they were going to transform neighborhoods.
      When the mass media increased their use of SpyTech, the chaos was exhilirating."<br><br>

         <div class="boxed"><br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;The closeted spies want to set me up with their female victims who are somehow connected to me.
           If you look at my Instagram followers, some of the faces are from Facebook.  It's the usual 
           identity trick.  (Although some of those accounts might also be the actual people just having fun.  ðŸ˜‰  Hey, these are the days!)
           What are their motives?  The closeted spies 
           are experts at occupying the line between bad and bad.  They want the best (worst?) of both worlds.
           They proudly consider themselves "perfect bisexuals", but
           everyone knows that doesn't last, especially with men, because it's just a "time and place" thing.  
           ("bi now, gay later")  Still, they're very good at the concepts of two's and three's.  
           Forget the concept of "one".  That's out of the question.  The closeted spies are the most dependent of all people.
           They might appear to be loners (because of the notoriety?) or to be asexual, but SpyTech has given them a huge boost
           (or a huge setback?) in prolonging their delusional ways of thinking.
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these tricks can be categorized, at least philosophically.  Spying, usually by definition,
           is a "closeted" action - secretive - but the spies proudly enjoy multi-tasking and taking risks.  They want to 
           maintain two or more concepts in their minds at the same time.  What is a more important and binary 
           subject than sex?  The closeted spy wants a threesome with me and his female victim, because he really wants just me.
           The female in that case is just a third-party pawn.
           (They know that a threesome with me and another man would be impossible to visualize with me in it.)
           What could be better than one big ego than two big egos?  Further still, what better to do with a catalog of victims than
           to rank the ones you want to abuse the most?
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Masculinity (sexuality) is a detail that I've noticed in the spies' desires.  For example,
           when I posted alot of music or when I'm adjusting my Spotify playlists, they seem to like white male artists.
           The spies will communicate to me whenever I so much as look at any other type of human - female, black, Asian, etc.,
           although the communication is usually a "yesno", like dogs barking at anything and everything.
           (Again, this is about the lowest level stuff - men who have determinedly de-evolved since Day One.)<br><br>

           After years of the spies' communications to me, the only thing left to figure out 
           was whether THEIR actions meant "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" in response to my actions.  Pssssh!  No-brainer!<br><br>

           Monday, January 15, 9:30 am:  two firetrucks and a dozen VERY LARGE MEN just to break an elevator?<br><br>
           The head guy was very tall.  He ACTUALLY THINKS HE'S BIG BROTHER.  (especially around children?)<br><br>

           &nbsp;&nbsp;"That guy didn't die.  No way," said the head spy, as he cranked up the SuperSatelliteSpyVision3000 with the added
           x-ray neutrino enhancement and the super nebular realtime enticement activation.<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;30 seconds later ... "Sure enough, there he is in his living room drinkin' a beer. I told you."<br><br>

           &nbsp;&nbsp;"This was their first time using the SpyTech to torture one of the expert nuisance spies, although it had been done years before by other countries.
           It couldn't be well-documented, for obvious reasons.  The only difficult part was getting the expert nuisance to agree to wear the device.
           They coaxed him into it surprisingly easily after praising his spying skills and telling him that the device would only increase his powers.
           Now every time he thought certain thoughts, ZAP!, the device remotely triggered the noisemaker, barely prodding him 
           with a tiny electrical spark.  He got used to it quickly.<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;However, it took much longer for him to figure out that now he <i>couldn't</i> stop the sound even if he tried.  
           In other words, he couldn't control the device, because he couldn't control his thoughts.  This particular device had logging 
           and tracking capabilities, of course, but they weren't needed with this guy.  After several 
           decades of using SpyTech, which had inevitably included VR headsets and bi-directional, pain-inducing particle beams, 
           he was already half dead.  In fact, the torture was now being deployed wirelessly, without any device."<br><br>

           "The older men in the crew had all gotten used to the expert nuisances by now, since they had all known about all the different SpyTechnologies
           for a long time,
           but the younger men were some of the expert nuisances' favorite victims.  In fact, anyone who didn't know much about particle physics or who simply
           denied that it was being used in SpyTech had minds that were still learning and vibrant and therefore still vulnerable.  
           The older men were braindead, literally numbskulls."<br><br>
